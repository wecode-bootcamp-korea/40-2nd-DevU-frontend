    "contents": "Figure 3 presents the average delay and packet delivery ratio in WMN with in- creasing number of gateways keeping number of nodes fixed to 50. Our method is presented by the red color whereas the green color represents the NGW technique and the blue color is the MLI technique. Figure 4 presents the average delay and packet delivery ration with increasing number of nodes keeping the number of gateways fixed to 5. As a consequence of the increase in the number of nodes there will be more number of nodes in each partition. Multiple gateways without clustering result in managing bigger tables at gateways hence backend traffic becomes significantly higher across the WMN. In contrast in our method backend traffic is restricted within the gateway span/partition/cluster. The active routing table entry at the gateways is significantly small because it manages on- ly the details of nodes within the gateways partition."
